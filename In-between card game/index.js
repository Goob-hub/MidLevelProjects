//The to do list

/* 
    -To start off I must first create an object that has the key-value pairs of every card that is usable

    -I will then grab the references to the neccesary html components so that i can attach functionality to them

    -Then I must create a function that activates when the button on the webpage is pressed to deal the player 1 card at random 
    
    (I could also just pre-draw the cards as the player presses the button so that I wont have to run a fucntion multiple times)

    -If that card is an ace, prompt the player to declare the ace high or low value

    -Then deal the next card to the player and prompt them to declare whether or not the next card they draw will be a value that is in between their current 2 cards

    -The player wins if the next card is in between and they lose if it is not

    -Create a function that clears the board after the game has ended and return the button on screen for the player to get dealt another card if they choose
